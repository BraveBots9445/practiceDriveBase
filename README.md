# Practice Drivetrain Template
This is the drivebase and vision template for the practice chassis for FRC 9445

It is set up to mostly mimic the Phoenix6 swerve template, but may not be fully implemented to its specifications. 

You will have to configure this before it actually runs. Mostly, this should happen in the Drivetrain class in the subsystems/drivetrain.py file

PRs welcome for feature aditions for parity and otherwise.
